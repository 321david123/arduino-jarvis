- "Jarvis, lights off"
- "Jarvis, how are you?"
- "Jarvis, scan"
- "Jarvis, be happy"
- "Jarvis, be excited"

### **Method 2: Bluetooth Commands**

Connect to "ESP32-Jarvis" via Bluetooth and send:

```
face:idle       - Neutral face
face:happy      - Happy expression
face:excited    - Excited expression
face:thinking   - Thinking expression
face:listening  - Listening expression
face:speaking   - Speaking expression
face:scanning   - Scanning animation

led on          - Turn LED on
led off         - Turn LED off
status          - Get system status
```

### **Method 3: Web Interface**

Open browser and go to the IP address shown on the OLED:

```
http://192.168.x.x/happy
http://192.168.x.x/excited
http://192.168.x.x/on
http://192.168.x.x/off
```

### **Method 4: Keyboard Commands** (in jarvis-brain.py)

While brain is running, type:

```
face idle       - Set face expression
face happy
say Hello there - Make JARVIS speak
led on          - Control LED
status          - Get status
help            - Show all commands
quit            - Exit
```

## 📝 Customization Guide

### **Change Voice Detection Sensitivity**

In `jarvis-complete.ino`, line 54:
```cpp
int voiceThreshold = 3000;  // Lower = more sensitive
```

### **Change Auto-Return Timeout**

In `jarvis-complete.ino`, line 172:
```cpp
else if (now - prevExpression >= 5000 && currentFace != FACE_IDLE) {
    // Change 5000 to your desired milliseconds
```

### **Add Custom Voice Commands**

In `jarvis-brain.py`, add to the `process_command()` function:

```python
elif "your command" in command:
    self.send_command("face:happy")
    self.speak("Your response")
```

### **Change Animation Speed**

In `face-animation-demo.ino`, line 32:
```cpp
if (now - lastFrame >= 3000) {  // Change duration (ms)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Face animations look weird:**
- Check OLED refresh rate (might be too slow)
- Make sure display is 128x64 resolution
- Try the face-animation-demo first to verify

### **Voice detection not working:**
- Check microphone wiring
- Adjust voiceThreshold value
- Test with loud sounds (clap, whistle)
- Check Serial Monitor for audio levels

### **Computer brain won't connect:**
- Verify port: `ls /dev/cu.* | grep usb`
- Make sure ESP32 is connected via USB
- Try: `python3 jarvis-brain.py /dev/cu.usbserial-0001`

### **Voice recognition not working:**
- Check microphone permissions on your computer
- Make sure you have internet (Google Speech API)
- Try speaking louder and clearer
- Check: `pip3 list | grep speech`
