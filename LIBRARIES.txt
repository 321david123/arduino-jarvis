→ Solution: Install Adafruit GFX Library from Library Manager

Error: "Adafruit_SSD1306.h: No such file or directory"
→ Solution: Install Adafruit SSD1306 from Library Manager

Error: "driver/i2s.h: No such file or directory"
→ Solution: Make sure ESP32 board is selected in Tools → Board

Error: A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32
→ Solution: Check USB cable, try different port, hold BOOT button while uploading
